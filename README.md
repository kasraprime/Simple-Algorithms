In this repo, I maintain some of the simple yet useful algorithms that I have implemented

`CoinChangeDP` is the dynamic programming method to solve coin change problem in which you are given
N (the amount of money to be changed to coins), and D (the number of different denominations), and also each denomination.
The question asks you to find the minimum amount of coins you need in order to change N amount of money to coins.
